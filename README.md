# Complete-PHP-Login-System
This is a complete login system for a web application, using php.

# How to Run
To run this application locally you will need to set up a local testing server, 
such as MAMP or XAMPP. This isn't a difficult process at all, both local server
solutions have an easy-to-use front end user-interface.

# Using MAMP & MySQL :globe_with_meridians:

The database and server configurations for MAMP & MySQL can be found at the <strong>start</strong> tab. 
This can be accessed through the <em>Open WebStart page</em> from the MAMP interface. 

The WebStart page link is in the center in this screenshot

# Directing MAMP to point to your project

In order for this application to appear on the server, we have to tell MAMP where our project directory is located. That way MAMP can properly release the web application to a local server.
