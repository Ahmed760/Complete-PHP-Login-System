# Complete-PHP-Login-System
This is a complete login system for a web application, using php.

# How to Run
To run this application locally you will need to set up a local testing server, 
such as MAMP or XAMPP. This isn't a difficult process at all, both local server
solutions have an easy-to-use front end user-interface.

# MAMP & MySQL

The database and server configurations for MAMP & MySQL can be found at the <strong>start</strong> tab. 
This can be accessed through the <em>Open WebStart page</em> from the MAMP interface. 

The WebStart page link is in the center in this screenshot
